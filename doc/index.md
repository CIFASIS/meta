\section tutorial-preface Preface

--------------------------------------------
*Meta: a tiny metaprogramming library* is the evolution of a minimal useful set
of primitives for manipulating lists of types introduced by Eric Niebler in
[this blog post](http://ericniebler.com/2014/11/13/tiny-metaprogramming-library/)
and used throught his
[range-v3 library](https://github.com/ericniebler/range-v3).

All of the source code in this project was written by
[Eric Niebler](https://github.com/ericniebler) as a set of utilities within his
[range-v3 library](https://github.com/ericniebler/range-v3) and is under the
Boost Software License (see the attached LICENSE.md) file.

I have made some minor tweaks to the comments, examples, test, and
documentation, and hopefully I haven't introduced any errors. If you find an
error or a bug please fill an issue, these are probably mine.

\subsection tutorial-installation Installation

--------------------------------------------
This library is header-only. You can get its source code from its
[github repository](https://github.com/gnzlbg/meta). To compile with
meta, you have to:

~~~~~~~{.cpp}
#include <meta/meta.hpp>
