# Meta: A tiny metaprogramming library

*Meta: a tiny metaprogramming library* is the evolution of a minimal useful set
of primitives for manipulating lists of types introduced by Eric Niebler in
[this blog post](http://ericniebler.com/2014/11/13/tiny-metaprogramming-library/)
and used throught his
[range-v3 library](https://github.com/ericniebler/range-v3).

All of the source code in this project was written by
[Eric Niebler](https://github.com/ericniebler) as a set of utilities within his
[range-v3 library](https://github.com/ericniebler/range-v3) and is under the
Boost Software License (see the attached LICENSE.md) file.

I have made some minor tweaks to the comments, examples, test, and
documentation, and hopefully I haven't introduced any errors (if you find any,
please fill an issue, it was probably introduced by me).

For a quick start see Eric Niebler's blog post:
[A tiny metaprogramming library]([this blog post](http://ericniebler.com/2014/11/13/tiny-metaprogramming-library/)). This
library is header-only, to compile with meta, you just have to: `#include
<meta/meta.hpp>`.
