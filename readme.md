# Meta: A tiny metaprogramming library

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ericniebler/meta.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ericniebler/meta)

_Meta_ is a C++14 tiny header-only metaprogramming library released under the
Boost Software License. To compile with meta you just have to:

```.cpp
#include <meta/meta.hpp>
```



For a quick start see Eric Niebler's blog post:
[A tiny metaprogramming library](http://ericniebler.com/2014/11/13/tiny-metaprogramming-library/). (Note: the names in Meta are different from those describe in the blog post, but the overall design remains the same.)
